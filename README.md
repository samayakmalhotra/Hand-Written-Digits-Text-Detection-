Hand Written Digits/ Text Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques.

Nowadays Deep learning has became a really important and popular tool for solving complex problems, performing data visualizations and helping researchers get deep insights on large and complex datasets. In modern world, Deep learning has been used for several practical applications like Driverless cars, MRI analysis, Image retrieval, gaming, etc.Handwritten digits and text detection is computer vision based task that includes numerous practical applications, such as optical character recognition and document analysis(for legal and research purposes).
In this 5 page essay, we will be discussing the use of deep learning techniques for handwritten digits and text detection. This would include pre-processing techniques and datasets that can be used for training and testing of our models. We will also be exploring various Deep learning models such as the CNNs, GANs and RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), and their application to handwritten digits and text detection.
With the help of Deep learning techniques we are continuously improving the accuracy and efficiency of OCR and document analysis applications.
In this paper we will also discuss about the fundamentals of deep learning and itâ€™s state-of- art.
